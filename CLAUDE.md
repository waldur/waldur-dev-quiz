# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Waldur Quest is a browser-based skill assessment game for Waldur developers. It uses Vue 3 + TypeScript to create an interactive quiz experience based on the Waldur Way skill system.

## Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173/waldur-dev-quiz/`).

### Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build        # Type-check + build to dist/
npm run preview      # Preview the production build locally
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking only
```

### Deployment

GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main`. The workflow is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The site is served at `https://waldur.github.io/waldur-dev-quiz/`.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Vue 3** with Composition API (`<script setup>`)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Pinia** for state management
- **Vue Router** for navigation
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **LocalStorage** for client-side persistence

### Data Model

**Skills** (`src/data/skills.ts`):
- 5 tiers: literacy, product, foundation, core, specialization
- Each skill has id, name, tier, description
- Weapon profiles (dagger → trident) based on T-shape progress

**Questions** (`src/data/questions.ts`):
- Keyed by skill ID, then by level (1-7)
- Format: `{ q: "question", options: ["a", "b", "c", "d"], correct: 0 }`
- Optional fields for learning assistance:
  - `explanation`: Text explaining why the answer is correct (shown after answering)
  - `learnMore`: Object with `url` and `text` for a tutorial link
- Helper functions: `getQuestionsForSkill()`, `getAvailableLevels()`, `hasQuestions()`
- Minimum questions per level: L1-2: 3, L3-4: 4, L5: 5, L6-7: 6

**Skill Levels** (`src/data/skills.ts`):
- Level 1: Aware (blue) - 100 XP
- Level 2: Competent (green) - 300 XP
- Level 3: Proficient (yellow) - 600 XP
- Level 4: Advanced (orange) - 1000 XP
- Level 5: Expert (purple) - 1500 XP
- Level 6: Master (pink) - 2100 XP ⭐ Advanced
- Level 7: Grandmaster (teal) - 2800 XP ⭐ Advanced

**Advanced Levels (6-7):**
- Available only for selected foundation skills and all specialization skills
- Visual indicators: Star badge on skills with advanced levels in skill tree
- Pink/teal button colors for level 6-7 in skill detail
- Topics cover latest features and advanced concepts (2025-2026 documentation)

**State** (`src/stores/game.ts`):
- Stored in localStorage under key `waldur-quest`
- Tracks: totalXP, skillProgress, achievements, currentProfile, stats

### Game Flow
1. **Menu** → shows player profile, stats, and help button
2. **Skill Tree** → browse skills by tier, T-shape progress panel with recommendations
3. **Skill Detail** → choose difficulty level, see skill description
4. **Quiz** → 5 questions with number hints (1-4), exit button, keyboard controls
5. **Results** → XP calculation, "Next Level" button if passed, or "Try Again" if failed

## Adding New Questions

Add to `src/data/questions.ts` under the appropriate skill ID and level:
```typescript
'skill-id': {
    1: [
        {
            q: "Your question text?",
            options: ["Correct answer", "Plausible wrong 1", "Plausible wrong 2", "Plausible wrong 3"],
            correct: 0,
            explanation: "Why the correct answer is right and/or why others are wrong.",
            learnMore: {
                url: "https://docs.example.com/topic",
                text: "📚 Learn More"
            }
        }
    ],  // min 3 questions per level 1-2
    // ... levels 3-4: min 4 questions, level 5: min 5 questions
    // ... levels 6-7 (advanced): min 6 questions each
}
```

**Skills with Advanced Levels (6-7):**
- Foundation: f-docker, f-git, f-ci-cd, f-linux, f-sql, f-testing
- Specialization: All 8 skills (s-kubernetes, s-ansible, s-openstack, s-azure, s-slurm, s-oidc, s-monitoring, s-gitlab-cicd)

### Question Writing Rules

**CRITICAL: All answer options must be plausible and similar in style:**
- All 4 options should be similar in length (don't make wrong answers obviously shorter)
- Most wrong answers should be believable - things a learner might actually think
- Occasional joke/absurd answers are fine for fun, but use sparingly (max 1 per question)
- The correct answer should NOT be obvious just by being longer or more detailed

**Other guidelines:**
- `explanation` and `learnMore` are optional but highly recommended for learning
- Use validated, stable URLs (official docs preferred over blog posts)
- Higher levels should have harder questions
- Each quiz pulls 5 random questions from the level
- Vary which position (0-3) the correct answer is in

## Adding New Skills

1. Add skill object to `skills` array in `src/data/skills.ts`
2. Add corresponding questions in `src/data/questions.ts`
3. Skills without questions are hidden from the skill tree

## T-Shape Developer Concept

- **Breadth**: Literacy (80%) + Foundation (50%) tiers form the horizontal bar
- **Depth**: Specialization skills at level 4+ form vertical spikes
- **Weapon profiles** evolve based on T-shape:
  - Dagger: Starting
  - Shield: Breadth complete (80% literacy, 50% foundation)
  - Spear: Any specialization at expert level
  - Lance: Shield + 1 specialization
  - Bident: Shield + 2 specializations
  - Trident: Shield + 3 specializations
